# Transit-Add-On

A mod that somewhat adds more things onto the Minecraft Transit Railways mod, with other additions unrelated. (Maybe for computers?)


# Additions

- Pylons - Pylons are added to signify what line color a station is connected to. These pylons are designed after the Washington Metro's Pylons, which are found outside all stations across all lines.
